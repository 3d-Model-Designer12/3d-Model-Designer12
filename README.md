Hi, I’m @3d-Model-Designer12

👀 I’m interested in 3D Modeling Software, Texturing and Shading, UV Mapping, Sculpting, Rendering, and all aspects of 3D design.
🌱 I’m currently learning Procedural Modeling, 3D Scanning, and Photogrammetry.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Character and Creature Design, Environment and Prop Modeling, and Problem-Solving projects.

⚡ Fun fact: I’ve produced high-quality CG models, both organic and hard surface, that adhere strictly to briefs and reference materials. I enjoy translating abstract concepts
   into visually compelling 3D assets, ensuring consistency in UV mapping and polygonal subdivisions for optimized models. I also love collaborating with lighting and FX teams to 
   enhance final outputs with hold-out and Match-Move geo.
